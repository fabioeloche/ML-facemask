# Facial Emotion Recognition System

## Business Understanding (CRISP-DM)

### Dataset Description
This project uses facial emotion recognition to analyze human emotions from images. The system processes facial images and classifies them into 7 distinct emotional states: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, and Neutral.

### Business Requirements
- **Primary Goal**: Develop an automated emotion detection system for customer sentiment analysis
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Customer service feedback analysis
  - Marketing campaign effectiveness measurement
  - User experience optimization
  - Mental health monitoring applications

**I want to** upload customer photos and get emotion analysis  
**So that** I can understand customer sentiment and improve service quality

**ML Task**: Multi-class emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

### User Story 2: Real-time Analysis
**As a** customer service manager  
**I want to** analyze customer emotions in real-time  
**So that** I can provide immediate assistance to frustrated customers

**ML Task**: Real-time facial emotion recognition with live camera feed

### User Story 3: Batch Processing
**As a** marketing team  
**I want to** analyze emotions from campaign photos  
**So that** I can measure campaign effectiveness and emotional impact

**ML Task**: Batch emotion analysis with performance metrics
